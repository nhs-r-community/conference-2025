Planning and materials for the conference

## Email signature

If they would like to, members of the conference committee are welcome to add our conference banner to their email signature to aid in advertising the event.  
Please note that you will need to manually add the conference website link (https://nhsrcommunity.com/conference.html) as a hyperlink attached to the image.
The image is stored in the 'img' folder, and will be replaced with an updated version whenever relevant (it is up to individual committee members to ensure they are using the most up to date image in their email signature).
